## General Information
- Project is built using Flask
- The purpose of this project is to gain more practice with flask
<!-- What problem does it (intend to) solve?-->
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Important
- Make sure to return something after each function
- Make sure to place if __name__ == '__main__' at the bottom of your python file/program
- Make sure to have Python enivornment variables set up or you will have to use py to run the code and pip will not be recongized
  
## Technologies Used
- Flask
- VSCode 

## Setup
The requirements for this project are simple and do not require much setup. You will need a code editor of your choice. I used VSCode because I could run commands in the terminal. There are no dependencies, only additional plugins if you would like to set them up in VSCode. If you are unsure, then I would say Pylint is okay but this just ensures your code is following code convention. You can get all the plugins in VSCode in the side menu, it looks like blocks. 

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
